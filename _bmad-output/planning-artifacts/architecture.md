# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
51 functional requirements (FR1–FR51) organized into 9 capability areas:

| Capability Area                  | FR Count  | Architectural Impact                                                               |

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
30 NFRs (NFR1–NFR30) driving architectural decisions:

- **Performance:** AI extraction <5s (p95), batch 20 docs <60s, dashboard <2s, DATEV export <10s for 500 invoices, search <1s, camera preview <500ms
- **Security:** AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, German data centers only, RLS at DB level, 30-day auth tokens, OWASP Top 10 compliance, no third-party AI training on user data
- **Scalability:** 20→500 concurrent users without re-architecture, 5M document records, 50GB archive, horizontal AI pipeline scaling via queue
- **Reliability:** 99.5%→99.9% uptime, daily backups (30-day retention), zero data loss guarantee, 4-hour RTO, graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- **Usability:** Completable at digital maturity index 5/100, German-only MVP, responsive down to 375px, max 3 clicks to any core action
- **Integration:** DATEV CSV import-compatible, AI provider swappable, Stripe webhook idempotency, >95% email deliverability

**Scale & Complexity:**

- Primary domain: Full-stack SaaS (web + PWA + AI pipeline + compliance infrastructure)
- Complexity level: **High** — regulated fintech with AI accuracy directly impacting tax liability
- Estimated architectural components: ~12 major components (auth, AI pipeline, document storage, archive, DATEV export, validation engine, PDF generator, billing, notifications, dashboard API, camera/capture, admin/settings)

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

| Constraint                    | Source      | Architectural Impact                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| German data residency (DSGVO) | Legal       | All infrastructure must be in German/EU data centers — blocks US-only cloud services                      |
| GoBD immutability             | Legal       | Once stored, documents cannot be modified — write-once storage pattern, cryptographic hashing             |
| DATEV EXTF format             | Integration | Windows-1252 encoding, semicolon delimiter, specific header structure — dedicated format generator needed |
| EN 16931 validation           | Regulatory  | Must validate against official KoSIT reference validator — either integrate or replicate validation rules |
| Solo developer                | Resource    | Every technology choice must minimize operational overhead — managed services preferred over self-hosted  |
| AI provider abstraction       | Strategic   | Must support Claude and OpenAI without user-facing changes — abstraction layer required from day one      |
| PWA with offline capture      | UX          | Service Worker + IndexedDB for offline photo queuing — adds client-side complexity                        |
| 10-year retention             | Legal       | Storage costs compound — need cost-efficient immutable storage with lifecycle management                  |
| No AI training on user data   | Privacy     | AI API calls must use zero-retention endpoints — contractual and technical guarantee needed               |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

1. **Tenant Isolation** — Every data access path must enforce tenant boundaries (RLS). Applies to: all database queries, file storage paths, AI processing context, export generation, audit logs.
2. **Audit Trail / Immutability** — Every document operation must be logged immutably. Applies to: document upload, AI extraction, user corrections, approvals, exports, deletions.
3. **AI Confidence & Human-in-the-Loop** — Confidence scoring propagates through the entire pipeline from extraction to review to export. Applies to: AI processing, UI rendering, export validation, accuracy tracking.
4. **Error Handling & Graceful Degradation** — System must remain usable even when AI services are down. Applies to: dashboard, archive access, DATEV export (for already-confirmed invoices), search.
5. **German Locale Consistency** — All user-facing content in German, number formatting (1.234,56), date formatting (dd.MM.yyyy), currency (€). Applies to: UI, DATEV export, PDF generation, email notifications.
6. **Security & Encryption** — AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, no plaintext financial data. Applies to: database, file storage, API communication, backup strategy.
7. **Performance Budget** — Strict p95 targets on AI processing and page loads. Applies to: API design, database indexing, caching strategy, asset optimization.

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

Full-stack SaaS (Next.js App Router + Supabase + AI pipeline) — Turborepo monorepo with self-hosted deployment on Hetzner via Coolify.

### Starter Options Considered

| Starter                            | Pros                                                                       | Cons                                                                                                    | Verdict                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **next-forge**                     | Production-grade, 20+ packages, Turborepo                                  | Clerk auth (not Supabase), Prisma (not Supabase), Neon DB, Vercel-centric deployment                    | **Rejected** — too many components to replace, defeats purpose of starter |
| **create-t3-turbo**                | Turborepo, TypeScript, Tailwind                                            | tRPC redundant with Supabase API, better-auth redundant with Supabase Auth, includes Expo (unnecessary) | **Rejected** — significant overlap/conflict with Supabase                 |
| **create-turbo + create-next-app** | Clean monorepo skeleton, zero opinions on auth/DB/deployment, full control | Requires manual setup of shared packages                                                                | **Selected** — minimal friction, maximum compatibility with chosen stack  |

### Selected Starter: create-turbo (vanilla) + create-next-app

**Rationale for Selection:**
The vanilla Turborepo starter provides monorepo infrastructure (workspace management, build caching, task orchestration) without imposing opinions on auth, database, or deployment — all of which are already decided (Supabase Auth, Supabase PostgreSQL, Hetzner/Coolify). This avoids the "rip and replace" anti-pattern where more time is spent removing starter opinions than building product.

**Initialization Command:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create Turborepo monorepo
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest rechnungsai --package-manager pnpm

# Step 2: Add Next.js app (inside monorepo)
cd rechnungsai/apps
pnpm create next-app@latest web --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --turbopack --no-src-dir

# Step 3: Initialize shadcn/ui in the Next.js app
cd web
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```

**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**

**Language & Runtime:**

- TypeScript (strict mode) across all packages and apps
- Node.js runtime (compatible with Coolify/Nixpacks deployment)
- pnpm workspaces for dependency management

**Styling Solution:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 (configured by create-next-app)
- shadcn/ui components (copied into project, full ownership)
- CSS custom properties for design token architecture

**Build Tooling:**

- Turbopack for development (Next.js native)
- Turborepo for monorepo task orchestration and caching
- ESLint for linting (shared config in packages)

**Testing Framework:**

- Not pre-configured by starter — to be decided in architectural decisions step (simple approach per user preference)

```

**Development Experience:**

- Hot reloading via Turbopack (sub-second refreshes)
- Turborepo remote caching (optional, local by default)
- Shared TypeScript and ESLint configs across all packages
- pnpm workspace protocol for inter-package dependencies

**Note:** Project initialization using these commands should be the first implementation story.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**

- Data access: Supabase JS Client (direct)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (Email + Password + Google OAuth)
- File storage: Supabase Storage (self-hosted)
- AI abstraction: Vercel AI SDK v5
- API pattern: Server Actions + Route Handlers
- Deployment: Dockerfile (multi-stage) on Coolify

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**

- State management: RSC + Zustand
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Email: Resend + React Email
- PDF generation: React PDF
- Monitoring: Sentry (cloud free tier)

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**

- Redis caching (Phase 2 — when rate limiting or session caching needed)
- Full observability stack (Phase 2 — Axiom/Better Stack when user base grows)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (Phase 2 — when test suite justifies pipeline)

### Data Architecture

| Decision        | Choice                            | Version                                   | Rationale                                                                                |

| Validation      | Zod schemas                       | Shared across stack                       | Same schemas for form validation, AI structured output, and API input validation         |

### Authentication & Security

| Decision              | Choice                                                | Rationale                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auth Provider         | Supabase Auth (self-hosted)                           | Integrated with DB, RLS enforcement, zero external auth dependency                      |
| Auth Methods          | Email + Password + Google OAuth                       | PRD-aligned. Email/password for Thomas (traditional), Google for Lisa (fast onboarding) |
| Session Management    | Supabase Auth JWT (30-day refresh)                    | PRD requirement: Thomas shouldn't re-login every Monday morning                         |
| Authorization         | Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security)                     | Database-level tenant isolation — zero cross-tenant data access by design               |
| API Rate Limiting     | Next.js Middleware (in-memory)                        | MVP scale, single server. Redis upgrade path for Phase 2                                |
| Encryption at Rest    | Supabase/PostgreSQL native + AES-256 for stored files | NFR7 compliance                                                                         |
| Encryption in Transit | TLS 1.3 (Coolify/reverse proxy)                       | NFR7 compliance                                                                         |
| AI Data Privacy       | Zero-retention API endpoints (Anthropic/OpenAI)       | NFR13: no third-party training on user invoice data                                     |

### API & Communication Patterns

| Decision           | Choice                              | Rationale                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutations          | Next.js Server Actions              | Zero API boilerplate, progressive enhancement, direct Supabase client access                                                                   |
| External Endpoints | Next.js Route Handlers              | Stripe webhooks, DATEV CSV download, AI callbacks — require HTTP endpoints                                                                     |
| AI Integration     | Vercel AI SDK v5                    | Provider-agnostic `generateObject()` for structured invoice extraction. Zod schema shared with forms. One-line provider swap (Claude ↔ OpenAI) |
| Email Service      | Resend + React Email                | 3K free/mo, >95% deliverability, JSX templates in monorepo, EU region                                                                          |
| Error Handling     | Structured error responses + Sentry | Conversational German error messages (UX requirement), Sentry for tracking                                                                     |

### Frontend Architecture

| Decision       | Choice                            | Rationale                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Fetching  | React Server Components           | Dashboard, invoice lists, stats — server-rendered, Supabase client server-side                                                          |
| Client State   | Zustand (minimal)                 | Camera capture queue, offline photo buffer, swipe gesture state — cross-component, client-only                                          |
| Forms          | React Hook Form + Zod             | shadcn/ui Form component built on RHF. Zod schemas shared across stack                                                                  |
| Animation      | Framer Motion                     | Swipe gestures (drag threshold + spring), cascade animations, layout transitions, `prefers-reduced-motion` support. UX spec requirement |
| PDF Generation | React PDF (`@react-pdf/renderer`) | JSX-based PDF templates for Verfahrensdokumentation. Server-side generation, no headless browser                                        |

### Infrastructure & Deployment

| Decision      | Choice                                 | Rationale                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hosting       | Hetzner Cloud (Germany)                | DSGVO mandatory — all data in German data centers                                    |
| Orchestration | Coolify (self-hosted on Hetzner)       | One-click Supabase, Git auto-deploy, built-in SSL, log viewer                        |
| Web App Build | Dockerfile (multi-stage)               | `turbo prune --scope=web` → minimal image, reproducible builds                       |
| Supabase      | Coolify one-click Supabase service     | Separate service from web app, own docker-compose                                    |
| CI/CD         | Coolify Git Push Auto-Deploy           | Main branch push → auto build + deploy. Solo developer, minimal overhead             |
| Monitoring    | Sentry cloud (free tier, 5K events/mo) | `@sentry/nextjs` — error tracking + performance. Coolify logs for general monitoring |
| Uptime        | Coolify built-in health checks         | Sufficient for MVP. External uptime monitoring deferred to Phase 2                   |

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**

1. Supabase self-host setup (Coolify) — foundation for everything
2. Turborepo + Next.js project initialization
3. Supabase Auth + RLS configuration
4. shadcn/ui + Tailwind + design tokens setup
5. AI pipeline (Vercel AI SDK + structured extraction)
6. Core features (capture, review, DATEV export, GoBD archive)
7. Stripe billing integration
8. Resend email notifications
9. Sentry error tracking
10. Coolify deployment pipeline

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**

- **Zod schemas** are the connective tissue: form validation ↔ AI structured output ↔ Supabase type validation
- **Supabase client** flows through Server Actions and Route Handlers — RLS always enforced
- **Vercel AI SDK** depends on Zod schemas from shared package for `generateObject()`
- **Framer Motion** gesture system (swipe-to-approve) drives Server Action calls (invoice approval)

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** 7 areas where AI agents could make different choices — naming, structure, response formats, date/currency handling, error handling, loading states, and Supabase client usage.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming Conventions:**

| Element      | Convention            | Example                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Tables       | snake_case, plural    | `invoices`, `audit_logs`, `tenant_settings` |
| Columns      | snake_case            | `created_at`, `tenant_id`, `invoice_number` |
| Foreign keys | `{singular_table}_id` | `tenant_id`, `invoice_id`                   |
| Enums        | snake_case            | `confidence_level`, `invoice_status`        |

**Code Naming Conventions:**

| Element             | Convention          | Example                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Files               | kebab-case          | `invoice-card.tsx`, `datev-export.ts`            |
| Components          | PascalCase          | `InvoiceCard`, `PipelineHeader`                  |
| Functions/Variables | camelCase           | `getInvoices`, `tenantId`                        |
| Zod schemas         | camelCase + Schema  | `invoiceSchema`, `datevSettingsSchema`           |
| Types/Interfaces    | PascalCase          | `Invoice`, `ExtractedField`, `ConfidenceLevel`   |
| Constants           | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE    | `MAX_FREE_INVOICES`, `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD_HIGH` |
| Server Actions      | camelCase verb+noun | `approveInvoice`, `exportToDatev`                |

**Route Naming Conventions:**

| Element             | Convention         | Example                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| App Router routes   | kebab-case folders | `app/dashboard/`, `app/invoices/[id]/`             |
| Route Handlers      | kebab-case path    | `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`                 |
| Server Action files | feature-based      | `app/actions/invoices.ts`, `app/actions/export.ts` |

### Structure Patterns

**Test Organization:**

- Co-located tests: `invoice-card.test.tsx` next to `invoice-card.tsx`
- Test runner: **Vitest** (fast, Jest-compatible API, minimal config)
- Test naming: `describe('InvoiceCard')` → `it('should show amber field when confidence < 95%')`

**Component Organization (feature-based):**

```
components/
  ui/               → shadcn/ui base (Button, Card, Badge, Sheet, etc.)
  invoice/          → accordion-invoice-card.tsx, confidence-indicator.tsx
  capture/          → camera-capture.tsx, processing-queue.tsx
  dashboard/        → pipeline-header.tsx, session-summary.tsx, weekly-recap-card.tsx
  export/           → datev-export-dialog.tsx, export-progress.tsx
  onboarding/       → trust-screen.tsx, first-invoice-guide.tsx
  layout/           → app-shell.tsx, mobile-nav.tsx, trust-badge-bar.tsx
```

**Server Actions Organization:**

```
app/actions/
  invoices.ts       → approveInvoice, flagInvoice, correctField
  export.ts         → exportToDatev, generateVerfahrensdokumentation
  auth.ts           → updateProfile, updateTenantSettings
  billing.ts        → createCheckoutSession, getSubscriptionStatus
  ai.ts             → extractInvoiceData, categorizeInvoice
```

### Format Patterns

**Server Action Return Format:**

```typescript
type ActionResult<T> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string };
```

All Server Actions return this format. Frontend checks `success` flag. Consistent, simple, type-safe.

**Date/Time Formats:**

| Context      | Format                           | Example                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Database     | ISO 8601 UTC (`timestamptz`)     | `2026-04-03T10:30:00Z`           |
| UI display   | German locale                    | `03.04.2026`, `03.04.2026 10:30` |
| DATEV export | `ddMM` (4-digit, year in header) | `0304`                           |
| JSON/API     | ISO 8601 string                  | `2026-04-03T10:30:00Z`           |

**Currency/Number Formats:**

| Context      | Format                 | Example      |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Database     | `numeric(10,2)`        | `1234.56`    |
| UI display   | German locale with €   | `€ 1.234,56` |
| DATEV export | German comma decimal   | `1234,56`    |
| JSON/API     | Number (decimal point) | `1234.56`    |

### Communication Patterns

**Supabase Client Usage:**

```typescript
// Server-side (Server Actions, Route Handlers, RSC)
import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
// → cookies() for auth context, RLS automatic

// Client-side (only when truly needed — realtime, offline sync)
import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
```

**Zustand Store Pattern:**

```typescript
// One store per feature domain, minimal scope
// stores/capture-store.ts
interface CaptureStore {
  queue: CapturedPhoto[];
  addToQueue: (photo: CapturedPhoto) => void;
  removeFromQueue: (id: string) => void;
}
```

### Process Patterns

**Error Handling:**

```typescript
// Server Action error pattern
try {
  // ... operation
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error("[invoices:approve]", error);
  Sentry.captureException(error);
  return { success: false, error: "Rechnung konnte nicht freigegeben werden." };
}
```

- Log prefix: `[module:action]` → `[invoices:approve]`, `[ai:extract]`, `[datev:export]`
- User errors: Always German, conversational — never technical codes
- Sentry: Full technical detail + stack trace

**Loading State Patterns:**

- Route level: Next.js `loading.tsx` files
- Component level: shadcn/ui `Skeleton` (invoice card shimmer)
- AI processing: Pipeline status progression (○ → ◐ → ● → ✓)
- No spinners anywhere — every loading state shows meaningful progress per UX spec

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**

1. Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
2. Return `ActionResult<T>` from every Server Action
3. Write all user-facing error messages in conversational German — no technical jargon
4. Use `createServerClient` server-side, `createBrowserClient` client-side only when needed
5. Define Zod schemas in shared locations — reuse across forms, AI, and API validation
6. Store currency as `numeric(10,2)` in DB, display in German locale (`€ 1.234,56`)
7. Prefix all log messages with `[module:action]` format
8. Co-locate test files next to source files using Vitest
9. Organize components by feature domain, not by type
10. Use ISO 8601 UTC for all date storage and API exchange

**Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN):**

- `any` type usage — always type explicitly or infer from Zod/Supabase
- Direct database queries without RLS context — always use Supabase client with auth
- English error messages shown to users — all user-facing text in German
- Inline magic numbers — use named constants (`CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 95`)
- `console.log` without module prefix — always `[module:action]` format
- Client-side Supabase client for data fetching — use RSC/Server Actions instead

### Development Workflow

**Local Development:**

```bash
pnpm dev                    # Turborepo runs Next.js dev + watches packages
supabase start              # Local Supabase (Docker)
supabase db diff            # Generate migration from schema changes
supabase gen types          # Regenerate TypeScript types
```

**Build & Deploy:**

```bash
pnpm build                  # turbo run build (packages first, then apps)
docker build -t rechnungsai .  # Multi-stage: turbo prune → install → build → runtime
# Coolify: GitHub push (main) → webhook → Dockerfile build → deploy container
```

## Architecture Validation Results

### Coherence Validation ✅

**Decision Compatibility:** All technology choices (Next.js 16, Supabase self-hosted, Vercel AI SDK v5, Turborepo, Coolify) are verified compatible. No version conflicts. Zod schema sharing across AI SDK, React Hook Form, and API validation creates a unified type-safety chain.

**Pattern Consistency:** Naming conventions (snake_case DB → camelCase TS → kebab-case files) are clean and non-conflicting. `ActionResult<T>` provides uniform Server Action interface. German error messages + `[module:action]` log prefix coexist without overlap.

**Structure Alignment:** Monorepo package boundaries enforce unidirectional dependency flow (shared → domain packages → web app). Feature-based component organization maps directly to UX spec components. All 51 FRs are mapped to specific directories.

### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅

**Functional Requirements:** All 51 FRs (FR1–FR51) have explicit architectural support mapped to specific packages, directories, and components. Zero uncovered requirements.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** All 30 NFRs (NFR1–NFR30) are addressed — performance via Next.js caching + async AI, security via Supabase RLS + AES-256 + TLS 1.3, scalability via PostgreSQL + queue-ready architecture, reliability via Coolify health checks + Supabase backups.

### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅

**Decision Completeness:** All critical decisions documented with technology choices and rationale. Deferred decisions (Redis, GitHub Actions CI, full observability) explicitly listed with Phase 2 triggers.

**Structure Completeness:** Complete project tree with ~120 files defined. Every file mapped to specific FRs. Package boundaries and dependency rules documented.

**Pattern Completeness:** 10 enforcement rules + 6 anti-patterns covering naming, formatting, error handling, data access, and state management.

### Gap Analysis Results

| Priority  | Gap                                          | Impact                                     | Resolution                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Important | Queue-based AI pipeline not detailed for MVP | Horizontal scaling deferred                | MVP: synchronous AI calls in Server Actions. Phase 2: BullMQ or Supabase Edge Functions |
| Important | PWA offline capture implementation shallow   | UX spec requires offline-resilient capture | MVP: basic Service Worker + IndexedDB queue. Phase 2: full offline sync                 |
| Minor     | German terms trigger spell checker           | Developer experience                       | Add `.cspell.json` with German accounting terms dictionary                              |

### Architecture Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Confidence Level:** High — all requirements covered, all decisions coherent, clear implementation path for AI agents.

**Key Strengths:**

- Zod schema unification across forms, AI, and validation — single source of truth
- Supabase self-hosted provides auth + DB + storage in one DSGVO-compliant infrastructure
- Package isolation ensures domain logic (DATEV, GoBD, validation) is testable independently
- Solo developer-optimized: managed services, minimal operational overhead, Coolify auto-deploy

**Areas for Future Enhancement:**

- Queue-based AI processing for horizontal scaling (Phase 2)
- Full offline PWA capabilities (Phase 2)
- Redis caching layer (Phase 2)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (Phase 2)
- Full observability stack — Axiom/Better Stack (Phase 2)

### Implementation Handoff

**AI Agent Guidelines:**

- Follow all architectural decisions exactly as documented
- Use implementation patterns consistently across all components
- Respect project structure and package boundaries
- Refer to this document for all architectural questions
- When in doubt about a pattern, check the Enforcement Guidelines section

**First Implementation Priority:**

```bash
# 1. Initialize monorepo
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest rechnungsai --package-manager pnpm

# 2. Add Next.js app
cd rechnungsai/apps
pnpm create next-app@latest web --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --turbopack --no-src-dir

# 3. Initialize shadcn/ui
cd web && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init

# 4. Set up Supabase (Coolify one-click or local dev)
supabase init
supabase start
```
